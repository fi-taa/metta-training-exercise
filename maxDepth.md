## Detailed Loop Invariant Explanation

### Initialization

The base case of the recursion handles an empty tree (`NilNode`). At this point, the depth is correctly determined to be `0`.

```lisp
(= (maxDepth NilNode) 0)
```
Here, the invariant holds because an empty tree has a depth of 0.

### Maintenance

For a non-empty tree represented by (TreeNode $root $left $right), the recursive calls to maxDepth correctly compute the depth of the left and right subtrees. The function then uses these depths to compute the overall depth of the tree.

```lisp
(= (maxDepth (TreeNode $root $left $right))
   (+ 1 (max (maxDepth $left) (maxDepth $right))))
```
The invariant holds at each step of the recursion because the function correctly computes the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees and adds 1 to account for the current node.


### Termination

When the recursion terminates, the base case of NilNode is reached, and the function correctly returns 0 for the depth of an empty tree. For non-empty trees, the recursive calls have correctly computed the maximum depth of the subtrees, and the final result is the overall maximum depth of the tree.
Summary

Initialization: The base case of the recursion (NilNode) correctly returns a depth of 0.
Maintenance: Each recursive call to maxDepth correctly computes the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees and maintains the invariant.
Termination: The final result of the recursion correctly reflects the maximum depth of the tree, confirming the correctness of the algorithm.
